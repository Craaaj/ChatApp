#Chat WebApp PROJECT OBJECTIVE 
The primary objective of the project is.  
• To develop a scalable and responsive chat application. 
• To implement real-time messaging capabilities 
• To ensure a secure and user-friendly interface. 
• To leverage the full-stack capabilities of the MERN stack. 

#TECHNOLOGIES USED 
Backend 
• MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user information and chat messages. 
• Express.js: Web application framework for building the backend RESTful API. 
• Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for executing server-side code. 
Frontend  
• React.js: JavaScript library for building the user interface. 
• Vite.js: Ridiculously Fast Development (Vite + React) 
Real-time Communication 
• WebSocket: Library for enabling real-time communication between the client and 
server.

#SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 
The architecture of the MERN stack Chat Application consists of the following components: 
• Client-Side: Development using React.js, responsible for rendering the UI and 
handling user interactions. 
• Server-Side: Build with Node.js and Express.js, responsible for processing requests 
and managing the WebSocket connection. 
• Database: MongoDB, used to store user data and chat logs. 

#IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS 

Backend Development  
1. User Authentication: Implemented using JWT and bcrypt. 
• Registration: User can register by providing a username and password. The 
password is hashed using bcrypt before storing in MongoDB. 
• Login: User authentication by providing valid credentials, generating a JWT 
for session. 
2. API Endpoints:  Defined using Express.js. 
User Routes: 
• POST /api/users/register: Endpoint for user registration. 
• POST /api/users/login: Endpoint for user login. 
Message Routes: 
• GET /api/messages: Endpoint to retrieve chat messages. 
• POST /api/messages: Endpoint to send a new message. 
3. WebSocket Integration: Using ‘ws’ library for real-time messaging.
